## Documentation Style Guide

### Text Formatting
1. Bullet Lists
   - Always add a blank line before and after bullet lists
   - This prevents lists from running into surrounding text
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     Here is some introductory text.

     - First bullet point
     - Second bullet point
     - Third bullet point

     Here is the following text.
     ```
   - This ensures proper visual separation and readability

2. Image Layout
   - Screenshots float right with text wrapping
   - Current width: 375px
   - Consistent margins and spacing
   - Clear separation between sections (4em margin)

## Remaining Tasks

1. Complete personal testimonial document:
   - Expand each section with detailed experiences
   - Add specific examples and memorable moments
   - Include practical tips from regular use
   - Consider adding quotes from birding companions

2. Review and enhance screenshots:
   - Review all screenshots for clarity and relevance
   - Identify locations where annotations (labels, arrows, etc.) would improve understanding
   - Verify that each screenshot properly relates to its surrounding text
   - Create list of any missing screenshots needed to better illustrate concepts
   - Consider adding callouts to highlight specific UI elements
   - Review screenshot sequence to ensure it follows a logical progression
   - Check for consistency in screenshot cropping and focus

- Improved text formatting with proper spacing around bullet lists

## Documentation Style Guide

### Text Formatting
1. Bullet Lists and Spacing
   - Always add a blank line before and after bullet lists
   - This prevents lists from running into surrounding text
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     Here is some introductory text.

     - First bullet point
     - Second bullet point
     - Third bullet point

     Here is the following text.
     ```
   - This ensures proper visual separation and readability

2. Numbered Lists with Nested Content
   - Use consistent 4-space indentation for all nested content
   - Keep numbered list items together without blank lines between them
   - Use hyphens (-) instead of asterisks (*) for bullet points
   - Add blank lines before and after nested bullet lists within a numbered item
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
         This is explanatory text under the first item.

         - A nested bullet point
         - Another nested bullet point

     2. Second item
         More explanatory text here.

         - More nested bullets
         - And another
     ```
   - This ensures proper list numbering and nesting

3. Lists with Images
   - Place images at the same indentation level as other nested content
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
         <figure markdown>
           ![Image description](/path/to/image.png){ .screenshot }
           <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
         </figure>

         - A nested bullet point
         - Another nested bullet point
     ```
   - This maintains list continuity while properly displaying images

4. Image Layout
   - Screenshots float right with text wrapping
   - Current width: 375px
   - Consistent margins and spacing
   - Clear separation between sections (4em margin)
   - Image resizing guidelines:
     * Store original high-resolution images in docs/images/originals/
     * Use macOS sips command to create display-sized versions:
       ```bash
       # For typical images where height â‰¤ width:
       sips -Z 375 docs/images/originals/image.png --out docs/images/image.png

       # For tall images where height > width:
       # Calculate height to maintain aspect ratio: (original_height/original_width * 375)
       sips --resampleHeightWidth [calculated_height] 375 docs/images/originals/image.png --out docs/images/image.png
       ```
     * Always ensure width is exactly 375px to match documentation layout
     * Use -Z for typical images, --resampleHeightWidth for tall images to guarantee 375px width
   - Best practices for image positioning:
     * Place image-container divs before the content they illustrate
     * Allow h3 headings to wrap next to images by removing clear:both
     * Use clear-floats div to force specific sections below images
     * For extended content wrapping (including headings), use content-wrap:
       ```markdown
       <div class="image-container" markdown>
       <figure markdown>
         ![Alt text](/path/to/image.png){ .screenshot }
         <figcaption>Caption text</figcaption>
       </figure>
       </div>

       <div class="content-wrap" markdown="1">
       Content that should wrap, including headings...

       ## This Heading Will Wrap

       More content that wraps...
       </div>

       <div class="clear-floats"></div>

       ## This Heading Appears Below
       ```
     * The content-wrap class:
       - Allows h2 headings to wrap next to images
       - Maintains proper markdown formatting
       - Use when you want multiple sections to flow around an image
       - Always close with clear-floats before content that should appear below

     * For side-by-side images:
       ```markdown
       <div style="text-align: center" markdown>
       <div style="display: inline-block; margin-right: 1em" markdown>
       <figure markdown>
         ![First image](/path/to/image1.png){ .screenshot }
         <figcaption>First caption</figcaption>
       </figure>
       </div>
       <div style="display: inline-block" markdown>
       <figure markdown>
         ![Second image](/path/to/image2.png){ .screenshot }
         <figcaption>Second caption</figcaption>
       </figure>
       </div>
       </div>
       ```
       - Centers the container and displays images side by side
       - Uses inline-block to prevent floating behavior
       - Maintains proper markdown image processing
       - Adds margin between images for spacing

## Completed Tasks (Feb 7, 2025)

1. Documentation Updates:
   - Updated all command formatting to use backticks (Say `foo`) instead of quotes
   - Added question mark button to all BirdTalk UI screenshots
   - Added darkened question mark button to confirmation screen
   - Standardized all screenshot sizes to 375px width:
     * Tutorial sequence (01-03, 05)
     * Sort views (04, 06)
     * Upload workflow (07-09, 19-20)
     * Upload buttons (upload_single, upload_multiple)
     * eBird upload screenshots (11-12, 16-18)

2. Image Sizing Standards:
   - All BirdTalk UI screenshots standardized to 375px width
   - Images stored in two locations:
     * docs/images/originals/ - Full resolution originals
     * docs/images/ - 375px width versions for display
   - Resizing method:
     * For images where height > width: use `sips --resampleHeightWidth [calculated_height] 375`
     * Calculate height as: original_height * (375/original_width)
   - Special cases:
     * Steve's photo on index.md uses custom sizing
     * Sort view screenshots (04, 06) positioned side-by-side in command reference

Note: All planned tasks have been completed. Future updates should maintain the 375px width standard for BirdTalk UI screenshots while preserving original high-resolution versions.

## Current Task (Feb 1, 2025)
Documentation restructuring in progress:
- Consolidating quickstart and tutorial content into new getting-started.md
- Removing redundant documentation files (screenshots-list.md, first-session.md, example-session.md)
- Adding BirdTalk and TestFlight logos
- Creating list-test.md for formatting experiments
- Updating navigation structure in mkdocs.yml
- Adjusting CSS styling in extra.css

Current challenges:
- Working on fixing layout issues in getting-started.md where nested bullet lists are not wrapping properly around images
- Investigating Claude browser error related to image dimensions:
  * All screenshots currently 800px in height
  * While no single image exceeds 2000px limit, the combined image load may be triggering the error
  * Potential solutions:
    - Reduce image dimensions (e.g., resize to 600px height)
    - Split getting-started.md into smaller pages
    - Lazy load images or use progressive loading techniques
    - Consider removing some redundant screenshots

- Improved text formatting with proper spacing around bullet lists

## Documentation Style Guide

### Text Formatting
1. Bullet Lists and Spacing
   - Always add a blank line before and after bullet lists
   - This prevents lists from running into surrounding text
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     Here is some introductory text.

     - First bullet point
     - Second bullet point
     - Third bullet point

     Here is the following text.
     ```
   - This ensures proper visual separation and readability

2. Numbered Lists with Nested Content
   - Use consistent 4-space indentation for all nested content
   - Keep numbered list items together without blank lines between them
   - Use hyphens (-) instead of asterisks (*) for bullet points
   - Add blank lines before and after nested bullet lists within a numbered item
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
         This is explanatory text under the first item.

         - A nested bullet point
         - Another nested bullet point

     2. Second item
         More explanatory text here.

         - More nested bullets
         - And another
     ```
   - This ensures proper list numbering and nesting

3. Lists with Images
   - Place images at the same indentation level as other nested content
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
         <figure markdown>
           ![Image description](/path/to/image.png){ .screenshot }
           <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
         </figure>

         - A nested bullet point
         - Another nested bullet point
     ```
   - This maintains list continuity while properly displaying images

4. Image Layout
   - Screenshots float right with text wrapping
   - Current width: 375px
   - Consistent margins and spacing
   - Clear separation between sections (4em margin)

## Current Task (Feb 1, 2025)
Documentation restructuring in progress:
- Consolidating quickstart and tutorial content into new getting-started.md
- Removing redundant documentation files (screenshots-list.md, first-session.md, example-session.md)
- Adding BirdTalk and TestFlight logos
- Creating list-test.md for formatting experiments
- Updating navigation structure in mkdocs.yml
- Adjusting CSS styling in extra.css

## Remaining Tasks

1. Complete personal testimonial document:
   - Expand each section with detailed experiences
   - Add specific examples and memorable moments
   - Include practical tips from regular use
   - Consider adding quotes from birding companions

2. Review and enhance screenshots:
   - Add a photo of BirdTalk in action:
     * Show a birder (John) using the app in the field
     * Include key equipment: binoculars and Bluetooth headset
     * Capture the moment of speaking a command
     * This will be featured on the landing page to visually demonstrate the app's hands-free usage
   - Review all screenshots for clarity and relevance
   - Add annotations (labels, arrows) to highlight key UI elements
   - Verify screenshots align with surrounding documentation text
   - Ensure consistent cropping and focus across all images
   - Maintain logical progression of screenshots in tutorials
   - Consider adding step-by-step numbered annotations for complex workflows
   - Add callouts to emphasize important interface elements
   - Create zoomed-in detail views for complex UI sections

## Documentation Style Guide

### Text Formatting
1. Bullet Lists and Spacing
   - Always add a blank line before and after bullet lists
   - This prevents lists from running into surrounding text
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     Here is some introductory text.

     - First bullet point
     - Second bullet point
     - Third bullet point

     Here is the following text.
     ```
   - This ensures proper visual separation and readability

2. Numbered Lists with Nested Content
   - Use consistent 4-space indentation for all nested content
   - Keep numbered list items together without blank lines between them
   - Use hyphens (-) instead of asterisks (*) for bullet points
   - Add blank lines before and after nested bullet lists within a numbered item
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
         This is explanatory text under the first item.

         - A nested bullet point
         - Another nested bullet point

     2. Second item
         More explanatory text here.

         - More nested bullets
         - And another
     ```
   - This ensures proper list numbering and nesting

3. Lists with Images
   - Place images at the same indentation level as other nested content
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
         <figure markdown>
           ![Image description](/path/to/image.png){ .screenshot }
           <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
         </figure>

         - A nested bullet point
         - Another nested bullet point
     ```
   - This maintains list continuity while properly displaying images

4. Image Layout
   - Screenshots float right with text wrapping
   - Current width: 375px
   - Consistent margins and spacing
   - Clear separation between sections (4em margin)
   - Best practices for image positioning:
     * Place image-container divs before the content they illustrate
     * Allow h3 headings to wrap next to images by removing clear:both
     * Use clear-floats div to force specific sections below images
     * For extended content wrapping (including headings), use content-wrap:
       ```markdown
       <div class="image-container" markdown>
       <figure markdown>
         ![Alt text](/path/to/image.png){ .screenshot }
         <figcaption>Caption text</figcaption>
       </figure>
       </div>

       <div class="content-wrap" markdown="1">
       Content that should wrap, including headings...

       ## This Heading Will Wrap

       More content that wraps...
       </div>

       <div class="clear-floats"></div>

       ## This Heading Appears Below
       ```
     * The content-wrap class:
       - Allows h2 headings to wrap next to images
       - Maintains proper markdown formatting
       - Use when you want multiple sections to flow around an image
       - Always close with clear-floats before content that should appear below

     * For side-by-side images:
       ```markdown
       <div style="text-align: center" markdown>
       <div style="display: inline-block; margin-right: 1em" markdown>
       <figure markdown>
         ![First image](/path/to/image1.png){ .screenshot }
         <figcaption>First caption</figcaption>
       </figure>
       </div>
       <div style="display: inline-block" markdown>
       <figure markdown>
         ![Second image](/path/to/image2.png){ .screenshot }
         <figcaption>Second caption</figcaption>
       </figure>
       </div>
       </div>
       ```
       - Centers the container and displays images side by side
       - Uses inline-block to prevent floating behavior
       - Maintains proper markdown image processing
       - Adds margin between images for spacing

## Current Status (Feb 2, 2025)
Improvements to getting-started.md layout:
- Fixed text overlapping with images by improving CSS for text wrapping
- Removed clear:both from h3 headings to allow proper wrapping
- Added clear-floats class for controlled section breaks
- Positioned first image to allow "The Basics" heading to wrap
- Forced "Essential Commands" section below first image
- More image positioning improvements pending

## Current Task (Feb 1, 2025)
Documentation restructuring in progress:
- Consolidating quickstart and tutorial content into new getting-started.md
- Removing redundant documentation files (screenshots-list.md, first-session.md, example-session.md)
- Adding BirdTalk and TestFlight logos
- Creating list-test.md for formatting experiments
- Updating navigation structure in mkdocs.yml
- Adjusting CSS styling in extra.css

Current challenges:
- Working on fixing layout issues in getting-started.md where nested bullet lists are not wrapping properly around images
- Investigating Claude browser error related to image dimensions:
  * All screenshots currently 800px in height
  * While no single image exceeds 2000px limit, the combined image load may be triggering the error
  * Potential solutions:
    - Reduce image dimensions (e.g., resize to 600px height)
    - Split getting-started.md into smaller pages
    - Lazy load images or use progressive loading techniques
    - Consider removing some redundant screenshots

## Completed Tasks (Feb 4, 2025)

1. Installation Guide (requirements-and-setup.md):
   - Removed numbering from top-level subsections under "Installation Process"
   - Preserved nested step numbering within each section

2. Getting Started Guide (getting-started.md):
   - Moved observation screen image up next to "Recording Birds" heading
   - Positioned "Viewing Your List" section below the observations image
   - Reorganized sort views section:
     * Added bullet points for sort commands
     * Arranged sort view images side-by-side below text
     * Updated image captions for sort views
   - Renamed "Basic Commands" to "Managing Observation Counts"
   - Added consistent "Say" prefix to voice commands
   - Improved help screen section organization
   - Fixed image filename for clarity (sort_by_species -> sort_by_time)

3. Documentation Structure:
   - Removed redundant test file (list-test.md)
   - Added side-by-side image layout pattern to style guide
   - Cleaned up documentation structure

## Remaining Tasks

1. Landing Page (index.md):
   - Replace BirdTalk logo with new Steve photo
   - Align Steve photo to the right with text wrapping left

2. Personal Testimonial:
   - Expand each section with detailed experiences
   - Add specific examples and memorable moments
   - Include practical tips from regular use
   - Consider adding quotes from birding companions

2. Review and enhance screenshots:
   - Add a photo of BirdTalk in action:
     * Show a birder (John) using the app in the field
     * Include key equipment: binoculars and Bluetooth headset
     * Capture the moment of speaking a command
     * This will be featured on the landing page to visually demonstrate the app's hands-free usage
   - Review all screenshots for clarity and relevance
   - Add annotations (labels, arrows) to highlight key UI elements
   - Verify screenshots align with surrounding documentation text
   - Ensure consistent cropping and focus across all images
   - Maintain logical progression of screenshots in tutorials
   - Consider adding step-by-step numbered annotations for complex workflows
   - Add callouts to emphasize important interface elements
   - Create zoomed-in detail views for complex UI sections

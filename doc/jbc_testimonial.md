- The familiar rhythm of phone-based eBird entry
- My wife's observation about phone distraction
- Defending the traditional approach
  * Need for immediate recording to avoid forgetting species
  * Still listening while entering data

## 2. Initial Hesitations
- Concerns about using BirdTalk
  * Worry about talking to myself in public
  * Fear of adding technological complexity

## 4. Freedom to Focus

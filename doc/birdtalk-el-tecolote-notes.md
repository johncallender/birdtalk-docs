# BirdTalk El Tecolote Article Project

## Project Goals
- Create an article for El Tecolote, the Santa Barbara Audubon Society chapter's newsletter
- Base the article on the testimonial in docs/testimonial.md, but rewrite it from the ground up
- Draw from other documentation in the project
- Answer the questions:
  1. What is BirdTalk?
  2. Why should I use it?
  3. What are the steps involved in using it?
- Keep the article relatively brief

## Source Materials
- docs/testimonial.md - John Callender's personal testimonial about BirdTalk
- docs/index.md - Overview of BirdTalk
- docs/getting-started.md - Basic usage instructions
- docs/installation/requirements-and-setup.md - Setup requirements

- docs/faq.md - Frequently asked questions
- docs/commands/reference.md - Complete command reference
- ../birdtalk-sources/el_tecolote_article_ideas.txt - Email thread about the article

## Context from El Tecolote Article Ideas
- The article is for El Tecolote, the Santa Barbara Audubon Society newsletter
- Steve Colwell (BirdTalk creator) suggested John Callender write the article based on his testimonial
- The article should be completed by August 1, 2025 (sooner is better)
- The article should be similar in length to a previous article about BirdView (8 medium-sized paragraphs and 6 pics)
- Including bird pictures is recommended as that's what the audience likes to look at
- Lynn Scarlett is the new editor for El Tecolote

## Bird Photo Suggestions

Based on the species mentioned in the article, here are suggestions for bird photos to accompany the piece:

### Mixed Gull Flock
As mentioned in the article: "When I encountered a large group of gulls at the beach, censusing them went from a mental juggling act to a smooth operation."

**Suggestion**: A photo of a mixed flock of gulls on a Santa Barbara beach, ideally showing both Western and California Gulls together. This would visually represent the scenario where BirdTalk is particularly useful for keeping track of multiple birds of different species.

### Rapid Observation Scenario
From the article: "A Song Sparrow singing while a Black Phoebe flies by? No problemâ€”enter both without looking away."

**Suggestion options**:
- A Song Sparrow in singing posture
- A Black Phoebe in flight or perched
- Or a habitat shot showing the kind of busy birding location where multiple species might be visible simultaneously

### Rare Bird Documentation
From the article: "One Solitary Sandpiper"

**Suggestion**: A photo of a Solitary Sandpiper, which would illustrate the rare bird documentation example. This would be particularly effective since the article mentions this specific species.

### Other Species Mentioned
- **Mockingbird**: Northern Mockingbird is mentioned as an example of adding multiple birds
- **Red-tailed Hawk**: Mentioned as an example of adding a single bird
- **Towhee**: Mentioned as a correction example (likely California Towhee or Spotted Towhee in Santa Barbara)

### Additional Ideas
1. **Bluetooth Headset**: A photo of the recommended OpenComm2 Bone Conduction headset, which is an essential part of the BirdTalk setup.

2. **Birder Using Binoculars**: A photo of a birder using binoculars with hands free (not holding a phone), representing the main benefit of BirdTalk.

### Recommended Photo Selection
For a newsletter article of this length (similar to the BirdView article with 8 paragraphs and 6 photos), I would recommend:

1. Steve using BirdTalk (already included)
2. BirdTalk interface screenshot (already included)
3. Mixed gull flock on a Santa Barbara beach
4. Song Sparrow or Black Phoebe
5. Solitary Sandpiper
6. Bluetooth headset or a birder using binoculars hands-free

### Photo Sources
- Personal collection of bird photos
- Other Santa Barbara Audubon members' photos
- Macaulay Library (connected to eBird) with proper attribution
- Stock photos if needed

## Considerations for Final Draft

1. **Length**: The draft is approximately 8 paragraphs plus examples, which matches the suggested length from the email thread (similar to Steve's previous BirdView article).

2. **Tone**: The article maintains a personal, testimonial tone while providing factual information about the app.

3. **Bird Photos**: As mentioned in the email thread, the audience likes bird photos. Consider adding 1-2 high-quality bird photos relevant to the Santa Barbara area, perhaps species mentioned in the examples.

4. **Technical Details**: The article provides enough technical information to understand what BirdTalk is and how to use it, without overwhelming readers with too many details.

5. **Call to Action**: The article concludes with clear information on how to get access to BirdTalk.

## Next Steps
1. Review the draft article for accuracy, clarity, and flow
2. Select final images to include from the photo suggestions
3. Consider adding a sidebar with a few additional tips or commands
4. Finalize the article for submission to Lynn Scarlett, the El Tecolote editor

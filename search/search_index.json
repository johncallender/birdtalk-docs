I knew and liked Steve, the app's creator; he and I had a fun, low-key competition in the county-year-list rankings a few years ago (Steve won by six species). So when I learned that he was working on an app that let you enter eBird checklists hands-free I was intrigued.</p> <p>At the same time, I had my own approach to eBird that I was comfortable with. With more than 2,500 days in my checklist streak, pulling out my phone to enter birds had become second nature.</p> <p>\"You're always staring at your phone,\" my wife would say when we birded together. She suggested I only enter birds every 15 minutes or so, recording them from memory during breaks in the action.</p> <p>I defended my continuous-updates approach. \"I forget birds if I wait. And it's not like I stop birding when I update the checklist. I'm still using my ears even when I'm looking at my phone.\"</p>"},{"location":"testimonial/#initial-hesitations","title":"Initial Hesitations","text":"<p>In hindsight there were other, unspoken reasons why I resisted. I've always wrestled with feelings of self-consciousness. As a boy I sometimes would hide my binoculars on the way to go birding, only pulling them out when I reached an area away from other people. In recent years I've relaxed about that; so what if people notice me birdwatching? But the idea of wearing a bluetooth headset to talk to BirdTalk made my inner self-conscious teenager cringe.</p> <p>There was also this: Over time I'd added to the paraphernalia I needed for birding: binoculars, field guide (now thankfully replaced in the field by my phone), and cameras that over time had become bigger and heavier. Did I really need another piece of technology? I was skeptical, too, of how well it would work. I imagined myself arguing with the app: \"No, American CROW!\" as passers-by altered course to give me a wide berth.</p>"},{"location":"testimonial/#taking-the-plunge","title":"Taking the Plunge","text":"<p>Eventually, though, as birding friends kept telling me about BirdTalk, I decided to give it a try. I bought the recommended bluetooth headset, a model that works by bone conduction, with lightweight pads that rest on the temples, leaving your ears unobstructed for birding. I followed Steve's instructions for downloading and installing the app and tried it on my next outing.</p> <p>The experience was transformative. Within minutes, I discovered that BirdTalk wasn't just another birding app \u2014 it was more like having a knowledgeable assistant who never tired, never complained, and never missed a beat. The voice commands were intuitive and few in number. Even better, I could speak quietly or whisper, perfect for those dawn chorus moments when you don't want to disturb other birders \u2014 or the birds.</p> <p>What impressed me most was how the app seemed to think like a birder. When I said \"Two crows,\" it knew I meant American Crows \u2014 the expected species in our area. When I spotted a rarity, I could be more specific: \"One Solitary Sandpiper,\" and BirdTalk would flag it appropriately.</p> <p>BirdTalk was a game-changer in many situations.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mixed Flocks: Censusing a large group of gulls at the beach went from a mental juggling act to a smooth operation. \"Four Western Gulls... six California Gulls... Western Gull... two more...\" BirdTalk kept perfect running totals while I kept my binoculars up and my eyes on the birds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rapid Observations: When arriving at a busy location, I could now record multiple species simultaneously. A Song Sparrow singing while a Black Phoebe flies by? No problem \u2014 enter both without missing a beat.</p> </li> <li> <p>Documentation: The \"memo\" command was great for documenting rarities:</p> <p>Me: \"One Solitary Sandpiper\"</p> <p>BirdTalk: \"Solitary Sandpiper, rare here and now\"</p> <p>Me: \"Memo, Feeding in the lagoon near coordinates. Photos to come.\"</p> <p>The app automatically replaced \"coordinates\" with my exact GPS location \u2014 a feature that has proved invaluable for rare bird documentation.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"testimonial/#a-convert","title":"A Convert","text":"<p>The true test came during a weekend when BirdTalk was temporarily unavailable during an update. I found myself reaching for my phone with increasing frustration, suddenly aware of how much time I was spending looking at the screen instead of at the birds. Each tap felt like a small interruption in my birding flow. When BirdTalk returned a few days later, the contrast was stark: I realized it hadn't added complexity to my birding \u2014 it had stripped it away.</p> <p>What I originally feared would be \"one more piece of technology\" had actually freed me from technology's constraints. Instead of juggling between binoculars, phone, and the natural world, I could simply be present with the birds. The app had become an invisible partner in my birding practice, enhancing rather than intruding upon my connection with nature.</p> <p>For those still hesitant about trying BirdTalk, I get it \u2014 I was there too. But if you're serious about using eBird to document your birding, this tool will revolutionize your field experience. It's not just about convenience; it's about rediscovering the joy of birding, unencumbered by the mechanics of record-keeping.</p> <p>You should give it a try.

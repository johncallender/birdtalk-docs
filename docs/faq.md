## General Questions

### What is BirdTalk's relationship with eBird?

## Voice Recognition

### Why does BirdTalk sometimes take longer to respond?

- BirdTalk waits for silence to know you've finished speaking
- In quiet conditions: responds within 1 second
- With background noise (wind, traffic): may take up to 3 seconds

### What if BirdTalk doesn't recognize a bird name?

- Try using a unique part of the name
- Repeat the exact same phrase
- Check the [command reference](commands/reference.md) for shorthand examples

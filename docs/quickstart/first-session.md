# Your First BirdTalk Session

This guide walks you through your first birding session with BirdTalk, focusing on the most essential commands you'll need.

## Before You Start

1. Ensure you're wearing your Bluetooth headset (if using one)
2. Be outdoors with GPS visibility
3. Have your eBird credentials ready

## Essential Commands Tutorial

### 1. Starting BirdTalk

1. Open the BirdTalk app
2. Test voice recognition:
    - Say: "Time"
    - BirdTalk should respond with the current time
3. If using a Bluetooth headset:
    - Say: "Switch"
    - This ensures audio is routing through your headset

### 2. Starting a Checklist

1. Say: "Start checklist"
    - BirdTalk will find your location
    - It will suggest the nearest eBird hotspot
2. If the suggested hotspot isn't correct:
    - Say: "Next" to see other nearby options
    - Or tap a different hotspot on the screen

### 3. Adding Birds

Basic format: "[Number] [Species Name]"

Examples:
```
"Three mockingbirds"
"One robin"
"Two cal quail"    (shorthand for California Quail)
```

Tips:
- If no number is specified, BirdTalk assumes "one"
- You can use shortened species names if they're unique in your area
- If BirdTalk doesn't recognize a name the first time, repeat the exact same phrase - it will try harder to understand

### 4. Reviewing and Adjusting Counts

To check current count:
- Say: "How many robins" (or any species)
- BirdTalk will tell you the total count

To adjust counts:
- To change the last entry: "No, three" (changes to 3)
- To add one: "One more"
- To subtract one: "One fewer"
- To change species: "No, towhee"

### 5. Ending and Submitting

1. When finished observing:
    - Say: "Stop checklist"
    - This stops GPS tracking

2. Review your checklist:
    - Look over the entries on screen
    - Say: "How many species" to get total species count

3. To submit:
    - Tap the checklist header (or say "Select checklist")
    - Say: "Submit checklist"

## Common Issues and Solutions

- If BirdTalk doesn't recognize a command:
    - Speak more clearly and slightly louder
    - Try repeating the exact same phrase
    - In noisy conditions, you may need to speak louder

- If you make a mistake:
    - Say "Scratch that" to remove the last entry
    - Say "Restore" if you remove something by mistake

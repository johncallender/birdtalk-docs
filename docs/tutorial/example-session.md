# BirdTalk Tutorial: Example Session

This tutorial walks you through a complete birding session with BirdTalk, showing how the app works in real-world scenarios. We'll cover starting a checklist, recording observations, handling common situations, and submitting your data to eBird.

## Starting Your Session

### Initial Setup
1. Before leaving home:
    - Turn on your Bluetooth headset
    - Open BirdTalk
    - Say "Time" to verify voice recognition is working

2. At your birding location:
    - Say "Start checklist"
    - BirdTalk suggests "Stow Lake, San Francisco, US-CA"
    - This is the correct hotspot, so we accept it

### First Observations
1. You hear a Song Sparrow:
    - Say "song sparrow"
    - BirdTalk adds one Song Sparrow to your list

2. You see three Mallards:
    - Say "three mallards"
    - BirdTalk adds three Mallards to your list

3. You hear another Song Sparrow singing:
    - Say "choose song sparrow" (selects the Song Sparrow entry)
    - Say "one more" (adds one to Song Sparrow count)
    - Say "memo singing" (adds breeding behavior note)

## Handling Common Situations

### Correcting Mistakes
1. You see what you think is a Black Phoebe:
    - Say "black phoebe"
    - Looking closer, you realize it's a Say's Phoebe
    - Say "no says phoebe"
    - BirdTalk changes the species

2. You count a group of gulls:
    - Say "twelve western gulls"
    - Recounting, you realize there are fourteen
    - Say "no fourteen"
    - BirdTalk updates the count

### Using Shorthand Names
1. You spot a Yellow-rumped Warbler:
    - Say "butter butt" (common shorthand for this species)
    - BirdTalk adds one Yellow-rumped Warbler

2. You see a Pacific-slope Flycatcher:
    - Say "slope"
    - BirdTalk adds one Pacific-slope Flycatcher

### Adding Comments
1. You notice interesting behavior:
    - Say "choose butter butt" (selects Yellow-rumped Warbler)
    - Say "memo foraging with chickadees"
    - BirdTalk adds the comment to your observation

2. You want to note the location:
    - Say "memo near stone bridge coordinates"
    - BirdTalk adds the comment with GPS coordinates from when the bird was first entered

## Managing Multiple Species

### Quick Counts
1. Checking your sparrow count:
    - Say "how many song sparrows"
    - BirdTalk says back "2 Song Sparrows"

2. Checking total species:
    - Say "how many species"
    - BirdTalk says back your current species count

### Group Observations
1. You encounter a mixed flock:
    - Say "three chickadees"
    - Say "two ruby crowned kinglets"
    - Say "butter butt"

2. Adding behavior notes:
    - Each memo will be attached to the species you select
    - Say "choose chickadee"
    - Say "memo foraging with kinglets and warbler"
    - Say "choose kinglet"
    - Say "memo actively feeding in willows"
    - Say "choose butter butt"
    - Say "memo part of mixed flock in willows"

## Wrapping Up

### Review and Upload
1. Before finishing:
    - Look over your checklist on screen
    - Verify all counts are correct
    - Check that comments are accurate

2. Submitting to eBird:
    - Say "stop checklist"
    - Say "select checklist"
    - Then choose:
        - Option 1 - Upload now:
            - Tap the upload button (up arrow pointing to cloud)
        - Option 2 - Upload later:
            - Say "upload later"
            - Your checklist will be saved
            - Useful when you want to:
                - Review details more carefully at home
                - Continue birding and create more checklists
                - Upload multiple checklists at once later

## Tips from this Session

- Keep commands simple and direct
- Use shorthand names when they're unique in your area
- Add memos while observations are fresh
- Review your checklist before submitting
- Use "upload later" if you want to double-check details

For a complete list of commands and features, see the [Command Reference](../commands/reference.md).

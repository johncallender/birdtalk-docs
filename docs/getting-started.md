### The Basics

When you first open BirdTalk, you'll see the main screen with options to start a new checklist or access previous ones. The interface is clean and simple, designed for hands-free operation. 

- Use pinch-to-zoom gestures to adjust text size for better visibility.

Before starting your birding session, test that BirdTalk can hear you.

- Uses the phone's internal mic and speaker by default, or the optional Bluetooth headset when available.
- If shows "Start" at top left, tap that to turn on the recognizer.
- Say `Time` to verify BirdTalk hears and responds with the time.
- For detailed audio troubleshooting, see [Tips and Tricks](tips-and-tricks.md#audio-equipment-tips)

**Recording Birds**

Use the basic format: Say "[Number] [Species Name]". For example:

- Say "Three mockingbirds"
- Say "One robin"
- Say "Scratch that" to remove the last entry
- Say "Two cal quail" (shorthand for California Quail)

<div class="clear-floats"></div>

**Managing Observation Counts**

Here are the essential commands for managing your observations:

- To check a count: Say "How many robins"
- To change the last entry: Say "No three"
- To add one: Say "One more"
- To subtract one: Say "One fewer"
- To change species: Say "No towhee"

## Detailed Tutorial

Now let's walk through a complete birding session, showing how BirdTalk works in real-world scenarios.

### Starting Your Session

- Turn on your (optional) Bluetooth headset
- Open BirdTalk
- Say "Time" to verify voice recognition
- Say "Start checklist"
- BirdTalk suggests "Stow Lake, San Francisco, US-CA"
- Start birding if correct, or say "Next" to step through available locations

### First Observations

- You hear a Song Sparrow:
    * Say "Song Sparrow"
    * BirdTalk adds one Song Sparrow

- You see three Mallards:
    * Say "Three Mallards"
    * BirdTalk adds three Mallards

- Another Song Sparrow singing:
    * Say "Song Sparrow"
    * Say "Memo singing" (adds breeding behavior note)

### Advanced Features

**Correcting Mistakes**

- Species correction:
    * Say "Black Phoebe"
    * Realize it's actually a Say's Phoebe
    * Say "No, Say's Phoebe"
    * BirdTalk changes the species

- You accidentally said "dove" and entered a Mourning Dove.
    * Say "Scratch" to remove the accidental entry.

- Count correction:
    * Say "Twelve Western Gulls"
    * Recount shows fourteen
    * Say "No, fourteen"
    * BirdTalk updates the count
    * You could also say "two more"

**Using Shorthand Names**

- For Yellow-rumped Warbler:
    * Say "Yellow Rump" or just "Rump"

- For Pacific-slope Flycatcher:
    * Say "Slope"

**Adding Comments**

- For behavior notes:
    * Say "Choose Yellow Rump"
    * Say "Memo foraging with chickadees"

- For location notes:
    * Say "Memo near stone bridge coordinates"
    * BirdTalk automatically replaces the term "coordinates" with the GPS coordinates where you initially entered that species observation
    * You can also say "Memo near current coordinates." The phrase "current coordinates" will be replaced with the coordinates where you were when you issued the command.

### Managing Multiple Species

**Mixed Flock Example**

- Record multiple species quickly:
    * Say "Three Chickadees"
    * Say "Two Ruby Crowned Kinglets"
    * Say "Yellow Rump"

- Add behavior notes:
    * Say "Choose Chickadee"
    * Say "Memo foraging with kinglets and warbler"
    * Say "Choose Kinglet"
    * Say "Memo actively feeding in willows"

**Quick Counts and Reviews**

- Check specific species:
    * Say "How many Song Sparrows"

- Check total species:
    * Say "How many species"

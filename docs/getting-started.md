### The Basics

When you first open BirdTalk, you'll see the main screen with options to start a new checklist or access previous ones. The interface is clean and simple, designed for hands-free operation.

Before starting your birding session:

- Test voice recognition by saying "Time"
- BirdTalk should respond with the current time
- If using a Bluetooth headset:
    - Turn it on before starting BirdTalk
    - BirdTalk will automatically use the headset
    - For audio issues, see [Tips and Tricks](tips-and-tricks.md#audio-equipment-tips)

1. **Starting a Checklist**

    Say "Start checklist" and BirdTalk will find your location and suggest the nearest eBird hotspot.
    If the suggested hotspot isn't correct:

    - Say "Next" to see other nearby options
    - Or tap a different hotspot on the screen

2. **Recording Birds**

    Use the basic format: "[Number] [Species Name]". For example:

    - "Three mockingbirds"
    - "One robin"
    - "Two cal quail" (shorthand for California Quail)

3. **Viewing Your List**

    BirdTalk offers multiple ways to organize your observations.

      <figcaption>Observations sorted by species name</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>

4. **Basic Commands**

    Here are the essential commands for managing your observations:

    - To check a count: "How many robins"
    - To change the last entry: "No, three"
    - To add one: "One more"
    - To subtract one: "One fewer"
    - To change species: "No, towhee"

5. **Getting Help**

    The help screen is always available - just say "Help"

## Detailed Tutorial

Now let's walk through a complete birding session, showing how BirdTalk works in real-world scenarios.

### Starting Your Session

1. **Initial Setup**

   - Before leaving home:
     * Turn on your Bluetooth headset
     * Open BirdTalk
     * Say "Time" to verify voice recognition

   - At your location:
     * Say "Start checklist"
     * BirdTalk suggests "Stow Lake, San Francisco, US-CA"
     * Accept if correct, or say "Next" for other options

2. **First Observations**

   - You hear a Song Sparrow:
     * Say "song sparrow"
     * BirdTalk adds one Song Sparrow

   - You see three Mallards:
     * Say "three mallards"
     * BirdTalk adds three Mallards

   - Another Song Sparrow singing:
     * Say "choose song sparrow"
     * Say "one more"
     * Say "memo singing" (adds breeding behavior note)

### Advanced Features

1. **Correcting Mistakes**

   - Species correction:
     * Say "black phoebe"
     * Realize it's actually a Say's Phoebe
     * Say "no says phoebe"
     * BirdTalk changes the species

   - Count correction:
     * Say "twelve western gulls"
     * Recount shows fourteen
     * Say "no fourteen"
     * BirdTalk updates the count

2. **Using Shorthand Names**

   - For Yellow-rumped Warbler:
     * Say "yellow rump"

   - For Pacific-slope Flycatcher:
     * Say "slope"

3. **Adding Comments**

   - For behavior notes:
     * Say "choose yellow rump"
     * Say "memo foraging with chickadees"

   - For location notes:
     * Say "memo near stone bridge coordinates"
     * BirdTalk adds GPS coordinates automatically

### Managing Multiple Species

1. **Mixed Flock Example**

   - Record multiple species quickly:
     * Say "three chickadees"
     * Say "two ruby crowned kinglets"
     * Say "yellow rump"

   - Add behavior notes:
     * Say "choose chickadee"
     * Say "memo foraging with kinglets and warbler"
     * Say "choose kinglet"
     * Say "memo actively feeding in willows"

2. **Quick Counts and Reviews**

   - Check specific species:
     * Say "how many song sparrows"

   - Check total species:
     * Say "how many species"

### Uploading to eBird

When you're finished observing:

1. Say "Stop checklist" to end the current checklist
2. Review your entries on screen
3. Choose your upload method:

   Option 1 - Upload now:

   - Tap the upload button (up arrow pointing to cloud)
   - Follow the prompts to complete the upload

  ![Upload form](/images/11_upload_ebird_form.png){ .screenshot }

   Option 2 - Upload later:

   - Say "Upload later" to save the checklist
   - When ready, select the checklist and tap upload

</div>

### Tips for Success

- Keep commands simple and direct
- Use shorthand names when they're unique in your area
- Add memos while observations are fresh
- Review your checklist before uploading
- Use "upload later" if you want to double-check details

### Troubleshooting

If BirdTalk doesn't recognize a command:

- Speak more clearly and slightly louder
- Try repeating the exact same phrase
- In noisy conditions, you may need to speak louder

If you make a mistake:

- Say "Scratch that" to remove the last entry
- Say "Restore" if you remove something by mistake

# Uploading Checklists to eBird

This guide walks you through the complete process of uploading your BirdTalk checklists to eBird, including both immediate uploads and managing saved checklists for later upload.

## Upload Options

### Option 1: Upload Immediately

When you finish a checklist, you can upload it right away. The process is straightforward:

1. Select your checklist by tapping the header or saying "Select checklist"
2. Tap the upload button (up arrow pointing to cloud)
3. Follow the prompts to complete the upload

The upload form provides all the necessary fields for submitting your checklist to eBird. Take a moment to review the details before submitting.

### Option 2: Save for Later Upload

Sometimes you might want to save checklists to upload them later. This is useful when you want to:

- Review your observations more carefully
- Wait for a better internet connection
- Upload multiple checklists at once
- Continue birding without interruption

To save a checklist for later:

1. Select your checklist
2. Say "Upload later" or use the menu options

<figure markdown>
  ![Marked for upload](images/08_checklist_marked_to_upload_later.png){ .screenshot }

</figure>

You can mark multiple checklists for later upload, which is particularly useful when you're doing several short counts in one area.

## Upload Process

When you're ready to upload your saved checklists, BirdTalk provides clear guidance through each step.

The file selection process is straightforward:

Once you've selected your file, you'll see the upload form ready for submission:

During the upload, BirdTalk shows a progress indicator:

Upon successful upload, you'll see confirmation screens:

<figure markdown>
  ![Upload successful](images/17_upload_successful.png){ .screenshot }
  <figcaption>Success confirmation</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure markdown>
  ![Upload confirmation](images/18_upload_confirmation.png){ .screenshot }
  <figcaption>Detailed confirmation screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure markdown>
  ![Upload completed](images/19_upload__completed.png){ .screenshot }
  <figcaption>Upload process completed</figcaption>
</figure>

After successful upload, BirdTalk marks the checklists as uploaded and collapses them:

<figure markdown>
  ![Checklists collapsed](images/20_checklists_deleted.png){ .screenshot }
  <figcaption>Checklists marked as uploaded and collapsed</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: If you need to re-upload a checklist (for example, if there was an error during upload), you can use the "Unfreeze" command to mark it as not uploaded. See the [Command Reference](commands/reference.md) for details.

## Tips for Successful Uploads

A few key points to ensure smooth uploads:

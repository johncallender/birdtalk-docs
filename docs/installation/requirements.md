- iPhone 6s or newer [Steve to confirm]
- iOS 15.0 or later [Steve to confirm]
- At least 100MB of free storage space [Steve to confirm]

### Accounts
You will need:

- Apple ID for TestFlight access
- eBird account for checklist submission
  - Create one at [eBird.org](https://ebird.org) if needed
  - Account must be fully set up and validated

## Internet Connectivity

### Required For
Internet connection is needed for:

- Initial installation and setup
- Downloading regional bird data
- Submitting completed checklists

### Field Usage
Once initial setup is complete, BirdTalk operates fully offline in the field.

## Audio Equipment

### Recommended Headset
While BirdTalk can work with your iPhone's built-in microphone, we strongly recommend using a Bluetooth headset for the best experience.

### Required Headset Features
A proper headset should include:

- Boom microphone for better voice recognition
- Bone conduction to keep ears unobstructed for birding
- Good noise isolation for the microphone

### Recommended Model
We recommend the [OpenComm2 Bone Conduction Stereo Bluetooth Headset by Shokz](https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenComm2-Conduction-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0C88R9FHG). This headset:

- Provides optimal combination of features for birding use
- Has been tested and verified by multiple users

### Environmental Considerations
Voice recognition performance varies with environmental conditions:

**Noisy Environment Adjustments**

- Background noise (traffic, wind, surf) requires speaking more loudly
- Wait for quieter moments when possible

**Quiet Environment Benefits**

- Normal speaking volume is sufficient
- Commands are recognized quickly

### Recognition Features
The app includes special features for challenging conditions:

**Repeat Recognition**

- When a command isn't recognized, repeat the exact same phrase
- This triggers more lenient recognition on the second attempt

**Microphone Switching**

- Use the "Switch" command to change between phone and headset microphones
- Helpful when one microphone performs better in current conditions

## Integration with Other Apps

### Merlin Sound ID Compatibility
When using BirdTalk with Merlin Sound ID:

- Start BirdTalk first for optimal audio control
- Both apps will share the same microphone input
- Switch to phone microphone if the headset reduces Merlin's bird detection
- Adjust settings based on your birding environment

## Optional Features

### Location Services
GPS enables several helpful features:

- Automatic hotspot detection
- Track recording during checklists
- Location stamping of observations

### Bluetooth Support
Bluetooth functionality:

- Required only when using a Bluetooth headset
- Bluetooth 4.0 or later recommended [Steve to confirm]

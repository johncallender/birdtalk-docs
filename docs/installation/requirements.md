# System Requirements

## Essential Requirements

### Hardware
- iPhone 6s or newer [Steve to confirm]
- iOS 15.0 or later [Steve to confirm]
- At least 100MB of free storage space [Steve to confirm]

### Accounts
- Apple ID
- eBird account
  - If you don't have an eBird account, you can create one at [eBird.org](https://ebird.org)
  - Your eBird account must be fully set up and validated

## Internet Connectivity

An internet connection is required to:

1. Complete initial installation
2. Download regional bird data
3. Submit checklists

Once initial setup is complete, BirdTalk can operate offline in the field.

## Audio Equipment

### Strongly Recommended: Bluetooth Headset
While BirdTalk can work with your iPhone's built-in microphone, we strongly recommend using a Bluetooth headset for the best experience:

- **Recommended Features:**
  - Boom microphone for better voice recognition
  - Bone conduction to keep ears unobstructed for birding
  - Good noise isolation for the microphone

- **Recommended Model:**
  - [OpenComm2 Bone Conduction Stereo Bluetooth Headset by Shokz](https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenComm2-Conduction-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0C88R9FHG)
  - Provides optimal combination of features for birding use
  - Tested and verified by multiple users

### Environmental Considerations
Voice recognition performance can vary based on environmental conditions:
- Background noise (traffic, wind, surf) may require speaking more loudly
- In quiet conditions, normal speaking volume is sufficient
- The app includes features to help with recognition in challenging conditions:
  - Repeating the exact same command triggers more lenient recognition
  - The "Switch" command allows changing between phone and headset microphones

## Integration with Other Apps

### Merlin Sound ID Compatibility
BirdTalk can run simultaneously with Merlin Sound ID, with some considerations:
- Both apps share the same microphone input
- Start BirdTalk before Merlin for optimal audio control
- Headset microphone may reduce Merlin's ability to hear distant birds
- Use the "Switch" command to change to phone microphone if needed for better bird sound detection

## Optional Features

### Location Services
- GPS capabilities used for:
  - Automatic hotspot detection
  - Track recording
  - Location stamping of observations
- Location Services must be enabled for full functionality

### Bluetooth
- Required only if using a Bluetooth headset
- Bluetooth 4.0 or later recommended [Steve to confirm]

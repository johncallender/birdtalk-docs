# BirdTalk Requirements and Installation Guide

## System Requirements

### Essential Requirements
- iPhone 6s or newer [Steve to confirm]
- iOS 15.0 or later [Steve to confirm]
- At least 100MB of free storage space [Steve to confirm]
- Apple ID for TestFlight access
- eBird account (create one at [eBird.org](https://ebird.org) if needed)

### Recommended Hardware
While BirdTalk works with your iPhone's built-in microphone, we strongly recommend using a Bluetooth headset for the best experience:

**Recommended Model**: [OpenComm2 Bone Conduction Stereo Bluetooth Headset by Shokz](https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenComm2-Conduction-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0C88R9FHG)

Key features:

* Boom microphone for better voice recognition
* Bone conduction keeps ears unobstructed for birding
* Good noise isolation for the microphone

**Optional Accessory**: For improved voice recognition in windy conditions, some users report a good experience with using wind muffs (small furry covers) for the microphone:

[Lavalier Wind Muff 2 Pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C88R9FHG) - These small foam covers significantly improve recognition accuracy in windy environments.

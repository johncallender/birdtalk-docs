# Requirements and Setup

## Requirements

- **iPhone** with iOS 15 or above
- eBird account (create at
<a href="https://eBird.org" target="eBird">ebird.org</a>
if needed)
- The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenComm2-Conduction-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0C88R9FHG" target="bonecondamazon">OpenComm2 Bone Conduction Stereo Bluetooth Headset by Shokz</a>:
    * A noise-canceling boom microphone is essential in the field.  Other options like Airpods or the phone's built-in microphone only work well in very quiet environments or in the car.
    * The bone-conduction headset keeps ears unobstructed for birding by ear.
    * This particular model works quite well with BirdTalk. Recently, inexpensive Chinese knock-offs have appeared, but these are so far untested.  Online reviews leave some doubt about their quality.  Caveat emptor.
    * (optional) Add wind muffs such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DJ38QZG" target="windmuffamazon">Lavalier Wind Muff 2 Pack</a> for even better recognition accuracy in windy environments.
- If the headset is a no-go for some reason, one option is the less expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX45Z2PV" target="neckholderamazon">Neck Phone Holder</a> which allows one to position the phone near one's mouth for hands-free use.
    * Not as effective nor as comfortable as the noise-canceling boom mic.
    * Is a little heavy around the neck
    * Works well in quiet locations.
    * Although BirdTalk's speaking back can be set to low volume, others nearby will hear it.

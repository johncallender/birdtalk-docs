# BirdTalk Requirements and Installation Guide

## System Requirements

### Essential Requirements

- iPhone 11 or newer
- iOS 18.0 or later
- At least 250MB of free storage space
- Apple ID for TestFlight access
- eBird account (create one at 
<a href="https://eBird.org" target="eBird">ebird.org</a> 
if needed)

### Recommended Hardware

While BirdTalk works with your iPhone's built-in microphone, we strongly recommend using a Bluetooth headset for the best experience:

**Recommended Model**: 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenComm2-Conduction-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0C88R9FHG" target="bonecondamazon">OpenComm2 Bone Conduction Stereo Bluetooth Headset by Shokz</a> 

Key features:

* Boom microphone for better voice recognition
* Bone conduction keeps ears unobstructed for birding
* Good noise isolation for the microphone

**Optional Accessory**: For improved voice recognition in windy conditions, some users report a good experience with using wind muffs (small foam covers) for the microphone:

- These small foam covers significantly improve recognition accuracy in windy environments.

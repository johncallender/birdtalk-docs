# Requirements and Setup

## Requirements

- iPhone
- eBird account (create at 
<a href="https://eBird.org" target="eBird">ebird.org</a> 
if needed)
- The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenComm2-Conduction-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0C88R9FHG" target="bonecondamazon">OpenComm2 Bone Conduction Stereo Bluetooth Headset by Shokz</a>:
    * BirdTalk doesn't work well in the field with Airpods nor with the phone's built-in microphone.  It does work well enough in a quiet room.
    * A noise-canceling boom microphone is essential in the field
    * Bone-conduction headset keeps ears unobstructed for birding by ear
    * This particular model works quite well with BirdTalk
    * Recently, inexpensive Chinese knock-offs have appeared, but no one has yet tested one with BirdTalk.
- (optional) Wind muffs such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DJ38QZG" target="windmuffamazon">Lavalier Wind Muff 2 Pack</a> for best recognition accuracy in windy environments.

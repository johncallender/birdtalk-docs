# BirdTalk Tips and Tricks

## Voice Recognition Success

### Speaking Techniques
- Speak clearly and consistently
- Use the same phrase when repeating commands
- Wait for quiet moments in noisy conditions
- Position microphone closer in windy conditions
- Speak slightly louder with background noise
- Try cupping your hand around the microphone
- Whispering, or whispering + cupping, can be effective when you want to avoid disturbing birds

### Bird Names
- Use unique parts of names for faster recognition
- Once a species is in your checklist, its name gets priority
- Check the [Command Reference](commands/reference.md) for shorthand options
- Repeat the exact same phrase if not recognized initially

### Response Times
- Normal response: within 1 second in quiet conditions
- May take up to 3 seconds with background noise
- BirdTalk waits for silence to know you've finished speaking
- Be patient in noisy environments

## Field Preparation

### New Location Checklist
1. Start a dummy checklist at your base location
2. This downloads the regional bird database
3. Once downloaded, you can bird offline
4. Submit checklists when back online

### Managing Multiple Checklists
- Create separate checklists for different locations
- Use "Stop checklist" to pause current list
- Start new checklist when changing locations
- "Insert checklist" splits observations into separate lists
- "Scratch" removes headers to combine lists

### GPS and Location
- GPS tracks your route during active checklists
- Records location for each observation (Steve to confirm)
- Can stop/resume tracking within same checklist
- Add location notes if GPS signal is weak
- BirdTalk automatically computes total distance covered with backtracking removed, per eBird guidelines

## Using with Other Apps

### Merlin Sound ID Integration
1. Start BirdTalk before Merlin
2. Both apps share microphone input
3. Use "Switch" command to change to phone microphone if needed
4. Headset might reduce Merlin's effectiveness

### Notifications
- iPhone silences notifications when Merlin is active
- Use Apple Watch for important notifications
- BirdTalk itself doesn't affect notifications

## Audio Equipment Tips

### Bluetooth Management
- iPhone handles two audio sources:
    - Internal mic/speaker
    - One Bluetooth device
- Most recently connected device takes control
- Use "Switch" command to toggle between devices
- Power cycle headset if having connection issues

### Optimizing Audio Setup
1. Connect Bluetooth headset before starting BirdTalk
2. Test voice recognition in different environments
3. Switch between phone and headset microphones as needed

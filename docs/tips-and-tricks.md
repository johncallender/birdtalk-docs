# BirdTalk Tips and Tricks

## Voice Recognition Success

### Speaking Techniques
- Speak clearly and consistently
- Use the same phrase when repeating commands
- Wait for quiet moments in noisy conditions
- Position microphone closer in windy conditions
- Speak slightly louder with background noise
- Try cupping your hand around the microphone
- Whispering, or whispering + cupping, can be effective when you want to avoid disturbing birds

### Bird Names
- Use unique parts of names for faster recognition
- Once a species is in your checklist, its name gets priority
- Check the [Command Reference](commands/reference.md) for shorthand options
- Repeat the exact same phrase if not recognized initially

### Response Times
- Normal response: within 1 second in quiet conditions
- May take up to 3 seconds with background noise
- BirdTalk waits for silence to know you've finished speaking
- Be patient in noisy environments

## Field Preparation

### New Location Checklist
1. Start a dummy checklist at your base location
2. This downloads the regional bird database
3. Once downloaded, you can bird offline
4. Submit checklists when back online

### Managing Multiple Checklists
- Create separate checklists for different locations
- Use "Stop checklist" to pause current list
- Start new checklist when changing locations
- "Insert checklist" splits observations into separate lists
- "Scratch" removes headers to combine lists

## Using with Other Apps

### Notifications
- BirdTalk itself doesn't affect notifications
- Use Apple Watch for important notifications

### Note About Merlin Sound ID
Due to a recent update, Merlin Sound ID is no longer compatible with BirdTalk. The apps cannot run simultaneously.
